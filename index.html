                    <p>No infrastructure mapping or legacy documentation exists. <strong>If AYWD leaves, the next IT person starts from zero</strong>. No consistent deployment records, credentials scattered, systems undocumented.</p>

                    <p>Lost administrator credentials with no recovery method configured means footage exists but <strong>cannot be accessed</strong>. When you need it most, it's unavailable.</p>

                        <p>Fourth, Square, Resmio, CCTV — all depend on quality internet. The £20-40/month DSL savings will be completely eroded by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Payment failures during service (Square needs connectivity)</li>

                            <li><strong>Equipment failure:</strong> Drive failure, power surge damage</li>
